          <h1>Roger Thomas</h1>
          <p>I am a creative person who loves to learn. I have always been drawn to everything creative. 
             From taking endless photography and art classes in school, to being a traveling musician and 
             learning the ins and outs of audio production. I first fell in love with web development while 
             trying to make a website for an early band of mine on a free website builder. I was fascinated 
             with how web applications are programmed and built from the ground up. I'm very new to this but 
             I'm excited to learn and grow. I can't wait for what the future holds for me in this industry.</p>
